Description:

In the digital age, ensuring the security of sensitive data is paramount. This C# project offers a comprehensive implementation of 13 popular data security algorithms, providing robust encryption and decryption functionalities along with thorough analysis capabilities. Each algorithm is meticulously designed and implemented to offer a reliable means of safeguarding data against unauthorized access.

Algorithms Implemented:

Autokey Vigenere: This algorithm combines the Vigenere cipher with a key based on the original message, offering enhanced security compared to traditional Vigenere.
Ceaser: Also known as the shift cipher, Ceaser encryption involves shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions.
Columnar: The Columnar transposition cipher rearranges the plaintext characters according to a user-defined key, offering a simple yet effective encryption technique.
Hill Cipher: A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, the Hill cipher encrypts plaintext blocks using matrix multiplication.
Monoalphabetic: This substitution cipher replaces each letter of the plaintext with another letter based on a fixed substitution key.
Playfair: A digraph substitution cipher, the Playfair cipher encrypts plaintext digraphs using a 5x5 matrix of letters.
Rail Fence: Also known as the Zigzag cipher, Rail Fence encryption involves writing the plaintext in a zigzag pattern across a specified number of "rails."
Repeating Key Vigenere: Similar to the Vigenere cipher but with a repeating keyword, offering enhanced security.
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing electronic data.
DES (Data Encryption Standard): A symmetric-key algorithm for encryption and decryption of electronic data.
Diffie-Hellman: A key exchange algorithm allowing two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
